# dayplanner

This is a basic time management program created using the tkinter module, written in Python. It can be used to keep track of events scheduled at different times of the day,
on different days using a basic calendar system. You can create multiple profiles, and are able to properly save, load, and delete data as needed. It doesn't keep track of the
current date or time, it's simply used as an organizational tool. It requires no other dependencies.

This program can be cloned using the command:

    git clone https://github.com/jms-guy/dayplanner
